When comparing the outputs of "traceroute" and "ping", a number of things can be noted. The first thing that I noticed
was that the "ping" command was generally more successful in reaching the target. More often than than not, the "traceroute"
command never received a response from the target, even for large and seemingly easy to reach sites like "bing.com". This
is likely due to the fac that the "traceroute" command asks for a response from each hop along the way to the target. It
is possible that some of these hops have increased privacy or are unable to return packets back to my machine, which is the
cause for the failure of the "traceroute" command. Another thing to note is that when both commands succeeded, the maximum,
minimum, average, and median values for the target were relatively similar between the "traceroute" and "ping" commands. This
is expected, but just goes to show the overall effect of the commands. Both of these observations have helped me learn more
about the nature of the internet and how data is transmitted.
